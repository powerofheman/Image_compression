This is a code for COMPRESSION OF IMAGES. The execution time is independent of the size of the image unlike other image compression techniques. The package contains the following files:

Demo.m           : A demo file, which can be run directly to view a sample result.
compressImage.m  : The function that compresses a single channel of the image
diffEvolution.m  : The function that computes the optimal threshold vectors
shannonEntropy.m : The file computes the shannon entropy for of the image for a particular threshold
368016.jpg       : A color image taken from Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark (BSDS)
368016.png       : The gray scale version of the image 368016.jpg
